# Parallel-solution-of-SLAE-with-tridiagonal-matrices
Solving SLAE with tridiagonal matrices using C/Python and MPI/OpenMP/Linux pthreads technologies

## Description
This repository presents the parallel algorithm for solving SLAE using two programming languages: C, Python ​​and three technologies: MPI, OpenMP, Linux.
In the file "ParallelProg_TridMatr.pdf" you can find a description of the algorithm and the results of testing its various implementations.
